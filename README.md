  pip install pillow
  ```
- **OpenAI**: Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install openai
  ```
- **PyGithub**: Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install PyGithub
  ```

or 
 **install all**: Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install openai
  pip install pillow
  pip install PyGithub

- **GitHub**: Youâ€™ll need a GitHub account and an API key (available in your GitHub settings).

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to download and use the project:

1. Navigate to the repository: [Release-Ledupey on GitHub](https://github.com/Nbtguyoriginal/Release-Ledupey.git).
2. Click the `<> Code` button, then click the `Download ZIP` button.
3. Extract the ZIP file to your preferred location (recommended: Desktop).
4. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder. Alternatively, open the folder and type `cmd` in the address bar.
5. Install the required resources:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow PyGithub openai
   ```
6. **Insert API Keys**:
   - Open `ledupey.py` in a text editor.
   - Locate line 180 and replace the placeholder with your GitHub API key:
     ```python
     token = "Replace with your own key"
     ```
   - Create a file named `config.py` in the same directory and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```python
     API_KEY = "Your OpenAI API key"
     ```

Once set up, double-click `ledupey.py` to launch the application.

## Detailed Code Explanation

### Loading Screen
The function `show_loading_screen()` creates a loading GUI that informs users while the application installs any required libraries. This function:

- Creates a new `Toplevel` window for the loading screen.
- Attempts to display a logo by resizing it from the local directory.
- Uses a `ttk.Progressbar` to provide visual feedback on the loading status.
- Automatically closes after 3.5 seconds unless interrupted.

### Installing Requirements
The `install_requirements()` function checks for any missing packages specified in `requirements.txt`. It uses `subprocess.check_call()` to run pip commands, which ensures that necessary libraries are installed seamlessly.

### Main GUI Class: `GitHubSearchGUI`
The `GitHubSearchGUI` class builds the main user interface, allowing users to:

- **Input Repository**: Enter a GitHub repository name or URL.
- **Search Keywords**: Input keywords for issue searching.
- **Select Browser**: Choose a browser to open relevant links.
- **Display Results**: Show search results and allow clickable links for easy navigation.
- **Save and Load Repositories**: Save frequently used repositories for quick access.

**Key Functional Methods**:
- `search_issues()`: Queries GitHub for issues based on user input and keywords. It handles errors such as invalid repository names gracefully.
- `open_url()`: Opens links in the selected browser and ensures that the URL is valid.
- `clear_results()`: Clears the results text box for new searches.
- `save_repo()`: Saves the current repository name to a text file, ensuring no duplicates.
- `load_saved_repos()`: Loads previously saved repositories from a text file, handling the case where the file does not exist.

### ChatGPT Integration: `ChatGPTPopup`
The `ChatGPTPopup` class provides functionality for users to interact with ChatGPT.

**Key Features**:
- **Temperature and Token Sliders**: Users can adjust parameters for the model's responses, allowing for varied outputs.
- **Ask DupeBot**: Sends a question to the ChatGPT model and displays the response, while keeping a history of the conversation.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- If the user enters a question but does not set the temperature or token limits, default values are applied.
- If the conversation history file does not exist when attempting to load, an error message is displayed.

## Example Usage
1. **Find a Plugin**: Log onto a Minecraft server and find a plugin.
2. **Search GitHub**: Type the plugin's name followed by "GitHub" (e.g., `https://github.com/GC-spigot/AdvancedEnchantments`).
3. **Input Repository**: Copy the repository link into the GUI and add relevant keywords (e.g., "dupe" or "glitch").
4. **Search for Issues**: Click "Findem" to search for related issues.
5. **Review Results**: Examine the results and identify potential duplication methods.
6. **Save Repositories**: Save repositories for quick access later.

### Additional Features
- **Color Picker**: Change the application's background color to personalize the interface.
- **Logo Customization**: Use a variety of logos to customize the loading screen.
